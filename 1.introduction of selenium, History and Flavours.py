selenium webdriver architecture diagram
-----------------------------------------------------

explanation:
---------------
*a Test Engineer will write set of instruction/script by using a programming lang is called as client/lang binding.

*a selenium webdriver will follow W3C protocol(World Wide Web Consortium).

3.selenium grid
--------------------
*the tests against a vast combination of browsers/OS, then you want to use Selenium Grid
